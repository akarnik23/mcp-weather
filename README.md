# Weather MCP Server

A FastAPI + FastMCP hybrid server that provides weather data, forecasts, and alerts for Poke integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **get_current_weather**: Current conditions (from National Weather Service forecast data)
- **get_forecast**: Detailed multi-day forecast (day/night periods)
- **get_weather_alerts**: Real-time alerts and warnings (NWS official alerts)

Data Source: National Weather Service (`https://api.weather.gov`) ‚Äî no API key required.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python src/server.py
```

## üîë API Key Setup

Not required. This server uses the National Weather Service API and does not need an API key.

## üö¢ Deployment

### Deploy to Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

**Steps:**
1. **Click the "Deploy to Render" button above** or go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Connect your GitHub account to Render** (if you haven't already)
3. **Create a new Web Service:**
   - Connect this repository
   - **Name**: `weather-mcp`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Plan**: `Free`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python src/server.py`
4. No environment variables required
5. **Deploy!**

> Note: On Render's free tier, services go idle after ~15 minutes of inactivity and may require a manual "Deploy" to wake or to pick up the latest commit. Unlike Vercel, pushes do not auto-deploy by default.

Your server will be available at `https://weather-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`

## üéØ Poke Integration

1. Go to [poke.com/settings/connections](https://poke.com/settings/connections)
2. Add the MCP URL: `https://weather-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`
3. Give it a name like "Weather"
4. Try: "Use the Weather MCP to get the 3-day forecast for Boston."

## üß© Architecture Note (FastAPI + FastMCP Hybrid)

Note: FastMCP 2.x responses didn‚Äôt work well with Poke‚Äôs client in my testing due to response format differences. The client expects simpler JSON but errors on FastMCP‚Äôs structured content with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')". This was reproducible with Interaction‚Äôs basic FastMCP template as well.

So for now, this server uses a hybrid architecture where:
- FastAPI endpoints deliver Poke‚Äëcompatible JSON
- `@mcp.tool()` functions exist as future‚Äëready wrappers
- Shared logic lives in `_http` functions to avoid duplication

To try pure FastMCP later:
1) replace the entire FastAPI main block with `mcp.run()`,
2) optionally move each `_http` function‚Äôs logic into the corresponding `@mcp.tool()` (or keep wrappers calling `_http`), and
3) remove FastAPI routes if no longer needed.

This works with Poke today while keeping a clean migration path to pure FastMCP.

## üîß Available Tools

- `get_current_weather(location, units="metric|imperial")`: Current conditions based on NWS forecast periods
- `get_forecast(location, days=1..5, units="metric|imperial")`: Multi-day forecast (day/night periods)
- `get_weather_alerts(location)`: Official alerts/watches/warnings for the specified location

## üìù Example Usage

```python
# Get current weather (uses NWS forecast period closest to now)
get_current_weather(location="Seattle", units="metric")

# Get 3-day forecast (day/night periods)
get_forecast(location="New York", days=3, units="imperial")

# Get weather alerts
get_weather_alerts(location="Miami")
```

Notes:
- Locations are resolved via a simple built-in mapping of major US cities. For other places, default coordinates are used. You can extend this with a geocoding service if needed.
- Current conditions are derived from the first forecast period when station observations are unavailable.
