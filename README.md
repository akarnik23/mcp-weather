# Weather MCP Server

A FastAPI + FastMCP hybrid server that provides weather data, forecasts, and alerts for Poke integration.

## 🚀 Features

- **get_current_weather**: Current conditions (from National Weather Service forecast data)
- **get_forecast**: Detailed multi-day forecast (day/night periods)
- **get_weather_alerts**: Real-time alerts and warnings (NWS official alerts)

Data Source: National Weather Service (`https://api.weather.gov`) — no API key required.

## 🛠️ Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python src/server.py
```

## 🔑 API Key Setup

Not required. This server uses the National Weather Service API and does not need an API key.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Deploy to Render

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy)

**Steps:**
1. **Click the "Deploy to Render" button above** or go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. **Connect your GitHub account to Render** (if you haven't already)
3. **Create a new Web Service:**
   - Connect this repository
   - **Name**: `weather-mcp`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Plan**: `Free`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python src/server.py`
4. No environment variables required
5. **Deploy!**

> Note: On Render's free tier, services go idle after ~15 minutes of inactivity and may require a manual "Deploy" to wake or to pick up the latest commit. Unlike Vercel, pushes do not auto-deploy by default.

Your server will be available at `https://weather-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`

## 🎯 Poke Integration

1. Go to [poke.com/settings/connections](https://poke.com/settings/connections)
2. Add the MCP URL: `https://weather-mcp.onrender.com/mcp`
3. Give it a name like "Weather"
4. Try: "Use the Weather MCP to get the 3-day forecast for Boston."

## 🧩 Architecture Note (FastAPI + FastMCP Hybrid)

Note: FastMCP 2.x responses didn’t work well with Poke’s client in my testing due to response format differences. The client expects simpler JSON but errors on FastMCP’s structured content with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'status')". This was reproducible with Interaction’s basic FastMCP template as well.

So for now, this server uses a hybrid architecture where:
- FastAPI endpoints deliver Poke‑compatible JSON
- `@mcp.tool()` functions exist as future‑ready wrappers
- Shared logic lives in `_http` functions to avoid duplication

To try pure FastMCP later:
1) replace the entire FastAPI main block with `mcp.run()`,
2) optionally move each `_http` function’s logic into the corresponding `@mcp.tool()` (or keep wrappers calling `_http`), and
3) remove FastAPI routes if no longer needed.

This works with Poke today while keeping a clean migration path to pure FastMCP.

## 🔧 Available Tools

- `get_current_weather(location, units="metric|imperial")`: Current conditions based on NWS forecast periods
- `get_forecast(location, days=1..5, units="metric|imperial")`: Multi-day forecast (day/night periods)
- `get_weather_alerts(location)`: Official alerts/watches/warnings for the specified location

## 📝 Example Usage

```python
# Get current weather (uses NWS forecast period closest to now)
get_current_weather(location="Seattle", units="metric")

# Get 3-day forecast (day/night periods)
get_forecast(location="New York", days=3, units="imperial")

# Get weather alerts
get_weather_alerts(location="Miami")
```

Notes:
- Locations are resolved via a simple built-in mapping of major US cities. For other places, default coordinates are used. You can extend this with a geocoding service if needed.
- Current conditions are derived from the first forecast period when station observations are unavailable.
